Half-centurion Danni Wyatt offered some resistance but Gardner took under a session to bundle out the five remaining wickets as she went on to register Australia's best match haul of 12 for 165 in women's Tests and the second-best of all-time."

The wrecker-in-chief for Australia was Gardner, who first had Kate Cross nicking behind after adding just six to her overnight score and then got wicketkeeper-bat Amy Jones stumped for only four. just as England went past the 150 mark."

Lauren Filer was guilty of playing down the wrong line, and was bowled trying to defend as the ball that beat the outside edge to crash into her off-stump. One delivery later, Wyatt was struck on pads in front, attempting to sweep the final ball of the over. A desperate review also couldn't save her as Australia marched to a famous 89-run victory."

Australia never took their foot off the pedal and took just 20 overs on the final morning to keep England to just 178 in reply."
