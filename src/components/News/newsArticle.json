Though that didn't seem sufficient, their bowlers took out opener Luis Reece and Haider Ali cheaply in the PowerPlay to retain hopes of getting to 12 points. However, du Plooy came out swinging and joined forces with Harry Came and Wayne Madsen for match-turning partnerships. The chase came down to Derbyshire needing 20 off the last two overs when Du Plooy and Brooke Guest launched into Ben Sanderson, taking 16 off the 19th. In the final over, Tom Taylor conceded five wides and brought an end to the chase."

Five of the top-six batters returned single-digit scores (including two ducks) as the batting side was down to 53 for 5 by the seventh over. A 91-run stand between opener Kiran Carlson - who survived the early wreckage - and Timm van der Gugten revived the innings as they got those runs in just 52 deliveries. Just when the batting side was set up for some late flourish, Josh Davey took out both the set batters in the same over (16th). From 146 for 7, Glamorgan were pushed to 171 courtesy small contributions from Andy Gorvin and Peter Hatzoglou."
